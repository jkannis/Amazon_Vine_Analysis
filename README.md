- There were 56 Vine 5-star reviews and 21,005 non-Vine 5-star reviews.
- 52% of the Vine reviews were 5-star reviews. 53% of the non-Vine reviews were 5-star reviews.

## Summary
Based on the results using the Outdoors dataset from Amazon, there does not appear to be any bias for reviews in the Vine program. The percentage of 5-star reviews is virtually the same for both the paid and unpaid reviews.
### Additional Analysis Recommendations
1. It might be interesting to consider the price of the items being reviewed when doing this analysis. Is it possible that the paid reviews tend to be for higher-priced items, which would benefit Amazon?
2. It might also be beneficial to consider other levels of ratings when comparing both groups.
